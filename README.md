# QuizzlerApp
Build an iOS Quiz App using MVC design pattern

The app will display a question on the screen, and there are three options for the answer. Whenever user taps on the correct answer,
the button will turn green and then the score will increase by 1. And then the next question will be displayed. If user taps on the wrong
answer, the button turn red and the score will not change, and the next question will be displayed. The progress bar will display the progress
